## Key Insights
1. Surface Distribution
* Hard courts account for the majority of ATP matches, followed by clay and grass, reflecting both tournament scheduling and surface availability on tour.
2. Player Specialization
* Player performance varies significantly by surface, with certain players demonstrating clear surface specialization rather than uniform success across all surfaces.
3. Match Intensity
* Clay-court matches show a higher likelihood of extending to a third set, suggesting longer rallies and increased endurance demands compared to faster surfaces.
4. Player Workload
* Players accumulate substantially more matches on hard courts, while select players show concentrated participation on specific surfaces, reinforcing strategic surface preferences.
